# Movie Quote Generator

## Description 
This is a simple practice project to help me learn some of the fundamentals of web development, including responsive design, data management, and handling DOM events.

## Features 
The app has a very simple interface - click a button and watch as a random movie quote is generated.

## How to Use 
This app can be used as a practice project of your own as there are still many more improvements that can be made to it. A few ideas come to mind:

-   create filters for movie genre, year, etc
-   make the app more mobile screen friendly
-   convert the movie array into a SQL database and practice backend skills

## Technologies 
HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Nothing crazy! I used a spreadsheet to create the 100 movie quotes that get appended into my array and included a CSV of the data for future use.
